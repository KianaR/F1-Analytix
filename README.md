# F1-Analytix üèÅ 
F1-Analytix is a work-in-progress EDA dashboard, designed to represent various datasets around Formula 1 Motorsport. The aim of this project was to expand on my current data analysis and maniuplation skills, using the Pandas library to prepare data and Streamlit to visually present said data to users.

A few main features I'd like to add to this project include:
  - Additonal representations for solo drivers
  - [Potentially] Additional pages for analysis on other areas of focus eg. circuits, seasons etc
